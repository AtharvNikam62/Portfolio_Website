# Portfolio_Website
Portfolio website 

This project is a portfolio website that showcases skills, projects and achievements as a web developer. The website consists of four main sections: Home, About, Portfolio and Contact.

⭐ The Home section is the landing page that displays my name, a brief introduction and a navigation bar that links to the other sections.

⭐The About section is where I provide more information about myself. I also list the technologies and tools that I am proficient in using.

⭐The Portfolio section is where I showcase some of the web projects that I have created or contributed to.

⭐The Contact section is where I provide my contact details. I also include a contact form that allows the user to send me a message directly from the website. 

The website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices. I use HTML to structure the content, CSS to style the layout and appearance, and JavaScript to add functionality and interactivity. I follow the web development best practices and standards, such as semantic markup, accessibility, cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization.
